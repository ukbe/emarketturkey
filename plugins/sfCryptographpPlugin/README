= Cryptographp Symfony Plugin =

Use the Cryptographp library to create Captchas in Symfony applications.

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin
  
  {{{
    $ symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfCryptographpPlugin
  }}}
  
  * Clear your cache

  {{{
    $symfony cc
  }}}  

== Configure plugin ==

This plugin can be easily configured with the app.yml file. See lib/crypt/config.inc.php
and http://www.cryptographp.com/index.php?page=33 for details about available options.

== Use the plugin ==

Two helper functions can be used in your template
{{{
use_helper('Cryptographp');
cryptographp_picture();
cryptographp_reload();
}}}
The first one display the cryptogram as described in the configuration file, the second one
is the reload button, if the user can't read the picture and want to use another one.

You must also create a validator for your form with sfCryptographpValidator, like this :
{{{
  crypto:
    required:
      msg:        security code required
    sfCryptographpValidator:
      code_error: security code incorrect
}}}
